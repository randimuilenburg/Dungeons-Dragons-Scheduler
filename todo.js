// TODO:
// 2. Make a new endpoint that accepts post requests to upload a characater image and ONLY a character image.
//    This endpoint should take in the image, write it to gridfs, and then use mongoose to update the character object
//    with the image location (use the same endpoint url as above just have it use a post request be different)
// 3. Write a get endpoint that returns an image from gridfs based on the location you provide
// 4. Come see Spenser
